# Reproducible class with environment and code

Reproducible class with environment and code.

## Slots

- `.xData`:

  (`environment`) environment with content was generated by the
  evaluation

- `code`:

  (`named list` of `character`) representing code necessary to reproduce
  the environment. Read more in Code section. of the `code` slot.

## Code

Each code element is a character representing one call. Each element is
named with the random identifier to make sure uniqueness when joining.
Each element has possible attributes:

- `warnings` (`character`) the warnings output when evaluating the code
  element.

- `messages` (`character`) the messages output when evaluating the code
  element.

- `dependency` (`character`) names of objects that appear in this call
  and gets affected by this call, separated by `<-` (objects on LHS of
  `<-` are affected by this line, and objects on RHS are affecting this
  line).
