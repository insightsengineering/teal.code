# teal.code

## Overview

`teal.code` is an R library providing tools to store code and an execution environment associated with it. The features
include:
* storing character literals as code,
* storing an execution environment,
* swapping the execution environment of the stored code,
* evaluating only parts of the stored code,
* means to execute code with a no-throw guarantee (errors demoted to warnings and messages stored for retrieval).

`teal.code` also ships a [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) module that helps inspect the stored code as well as messages, warnings and error
messages resulting from evaluation via `shiny` web application.
