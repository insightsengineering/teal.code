## Overview

`teal.code` is an R library providing tools to store code and an execution environment associated with it. The features
include:

* an object `qenv` for storing code and an execution environment which integrates well with `shiny reactives` for use in `shiny` applications whose outputs require reproducibility (i.e. the code used to generate them)
* ability to chain and join `qenv` objects together to provide fine-grained control over executed code
* automatic error and warning handling for executed code

`teal.code` also ships a [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) module that helps inspect the stored code as well as messages, warnings and error messages resulting from evaluation via `shiny` web application.

## Installation

```r
# stable versions
install.packages('teal.code')

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal.code@*release")
```

Alternatively, you might want to use the development version available on [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/).

```r
# beta versions
install.packages('teal.code', repos = c('https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev', getOption('repos')))

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal.code")
```

## Usage

To understand how to use this package, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code/latest-tag/articles/teal-code.html) article, which provides multiple examples of code implementation.

Below is the showcase of the example usage

```r
library(teal.code)
my_qenv <- new_qenv(env = list2env(list(x = 5)), code = "x <- 5")
my_qenv
#> Parent: <environment: package:teal.code>
#> Bindings:
#> â€¢ x: <dbl> [L]
```

```r
qenv_2 <- eval_code(my_qenv, "y <- x * 2") |> eval_code("z <- y * 2")
qenv_2
#> <environment: 0x00000135b544cfe8> [L]
#> Parent: <environment: package:teal.code>
#> Bindings:
#> â€¢ x: <dbl> [L]
#> â€¢ y: <dbl> [L]
#> â€¢ z: <dbl> [L]
```

```r
qenv_2[["y"]]
#> [1] 10
```

```r
cat(paste(get_code(qenv_2), collapse = "\n"))
#> x <- 5
#> y <- x * 2
#> z <- y * 2
```
