\item{data}{(\code{qenv})}

\item{expr}{(\code{expression}) to evaluate. Must be inline code, see \verb{Using language objects...}}

\description{
Evaluate code in \code{qenv}
}
\details{
\code{within()} is a convenience method that wraps \code{eval_code} to provide a simplified way of passing expression.
\code{within} accepts only inline expressions (both simple and compound) and allows to substitute \code{expr}
with \code{...} named argument values.
Functions that trigger side effects like \code{options} or \code{set.seed} can be linked to specific objects for further code retrieval (with \code{get_code}), but only through \code{eval_code} where code input as \code{character}. \code{within} works on \code{expressions} that do not preserve comments, hence you can not use \verb{# @linksto} tag explained in \code{get_code}.
}
\section{Using language objects with \code{within}}{

Passing language objects to \code{expr} is generally not intended but can be achieved with \code{do.call}.
Only single \code{expression}s will work and substitution is not available. See examples.
