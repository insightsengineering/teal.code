## Decoupling chunks containers

In a shiny app there is often a need to have multiple chunks containers that may be used independently by certain parts of the application and may be used together by other parts of the application. The ability to have multiple chunks containers combined into one allows for greater flexibility of the code, which allows the developer to apply the `DRY` principle (stands for `Do not repeat` which means code that are used in multiple places should only be written and defined once) and optimize performance. Much of the functionality to use a single chunks container object independently has already been covered in the [Basic chunks](./basic_chunks.Rmd) vignette, which you should read first before going any further.

## Creating a chunks container and assigning it to a variable

In order to have multiple chunks containers, each must be accessible and distinguishable via a variable.

```{r}
ch_0 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_1 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_2 <- teal.code::chunks_new()

# if data used is static, then it should be computed once
# isolating it into its own chunks container accomplishes this goal
ch_0$push(quote(df <- data.frame(a = runif(5, -10, 10), b = runif(5, -10, 10))))
ch_1$push(quote({
  Sys.sleep(1) # some really long running process
  foo_plot <- function(df_arg) plot(df_arg)
}))
ch_2$push(quote({
  Sys.sleep(1) # some really long running process
  foo_print <- function(df_arg) df_arg
}))

# chunks containers should be evaluated before being merged
# the reason for this will be explain later
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_0)
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_1)
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_2)
```

The `teal.code::chunks_push_chunks` function is called to combine chunks containers together. Note that the base chunks container to start combining from in the following examples are all empty. However, that does not have to be the case. Starting with a clean slate is easier to comprehend.

Perhaps a part of your shiny application needs to output a plot

```{r}
ch_plot <- teal.code::chunks_new()
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_plot, x = ch_0)
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_plot, x = ch_1)
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_plot, expression = quote(foo_plot(df)))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_plot)
```

Perhaps a part of your shiny application needs to output a table

```{r}
ch_table <- teal.code::chunks_new()
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_table, x = ch_0)
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_table, x = ch_2)
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_table, expression = quote(foo_print(df)))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_table)
```

Perhaps the main part of your shiny application needs to output a plot, a table, and the code to generate both

```{r}
ch_ouput <- teal.code::chunks_new()
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_ouput, x = ch_0)
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_ouput, x = ch_1)
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_ouput, x = ch_2)
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_ouput, expression = quote(foo_plot(df)))
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_ouput, expression = quote(foo_print(df)))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_ouput)

code <- teal.code::chunks_get_rcode(chunks = ch_ouput)
cat(
  paste(code, collapse = "\n")
)
```

When chunks containers are merged together, their code expressions are combined in the order that the containers were merged and their environments are combined into a single environment. 

Even in the event that the expressions that are combined will lead to errors being thrown when evaluated, there is no way for the chunks object to know that before evaluation. Hence code expressions will not interrupt the merging of chunks containers together.

However, the potential conflict of when two chunks containers have the same variables which holds different values in their respective environments will throw an error when merging chunks containers.

```{r}
ch_0 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_1 <- teal.code::chunks_new()

ch_0$push(quote(a_var <- 0))
ch_1$push(quote(a_var <- 0))

teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_0)
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_1)

# OK - operation is successful as the variable a_var holds the same value in both chunks
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_0, x = ch_1)

ch_2 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_2$push(quote(a_var <- 1))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_2)

# ERROR - operation is rejected as the variable a_var holds different values
tryCatch(
  teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_0, x = ch_2),
  error = function(e) e
)
```

### Why should you evaluate before merging?

With the exception of code that is meant to return something at the end of a function, code usually modifies the environment and / or the variables inside the environment.

When chunks containers have code that have not been evaluated, these code will not block any merging operations as explained above. But if they are evaluated, then their environment will be updated and will reflect the intended state of the chunks container as described by the code expressions.

And as described above, it is the environment that will block the operation to merge chunks containers together when there are conflicts. So evaluating before merging will prevent some bugs in your app.

```{r}
ch_0 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_0$push(quote(a_var <- 0))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_0)

ch_2 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_2$push(quote(a_var <- 1))

# note that ch_2 is not evaluated

# OK - operation is successful
teal.code::chunks_push_chunks(chunks = ch_0, x = ch_2)
```


## Cloning a chunks container

A chunks container is an R6 reference class, so by default contains a `clone` method. A deep copy is needed if some part of your app needs to start from the state of an already existing chunks container and modify or add on to it, but some other part of your app still needs the original chunks container unaltered.

The example code below is another way to print the plot above, which starts combining chunks from a non-empty chunks container derived from cloning another chunks container

```{r}
ch_0 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_0$push(quote({
  df <- data.frame(a = runif(5, -10, 10), b = runif(5, -10, 10))
  foo_plot <- function(df_arg) plot(df_arg)
}))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_0)

ch_plot_clone <- ch_0$clone(deep = TRUE)
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_plot_clone, expression = quote(foo_plot(df)))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_plot_clone)
```

## Extracting values of variables in a chunks container

In order to extract values of variables inside a chunks container, the code that generates that variable must have been evaluated

```{r}
ch_0 <- teal.code::chunks_new()
ch_0$push(quote(df <- data.frame(a = runif(5, -10, 10), b = runif(5, -10, 10))))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_0)

env <- new.env()
env$df <- teal.code::chunks_get_var(var = "df", chunks = ch_0)

# Once extracted, the value can be passed into other chunks containers if needed

ch_print_df <- teal.code::chunks_new()
teal.code::chunks_reset(envir = env, chunks = ch_print_df)
teal.code::chunks_push(chunks = ch_print_df, expression = quote(df))
teal.code::chunks_safe_eval(chunks = ch_print_df)
```


# Example

The following is a shiny app that uses the chunks container object in ways that mirror how a sophistical `teal` app would use it. This app constructs several chunks containers, allowing each to be used and combined by different parts of the app, which enables the app to apply the `DRY` principle and optimize performance.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
