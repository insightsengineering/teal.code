Reproducibility stands as a pivotal feature within the realm of data analysis for several compelling reasons:

- It empowers users to recreate outputs effortlessly within a standard R console, independent of a reactive shiny app.
- It fosters transparency, elucidating the analytical process for both users and stakeholders.

In this context, the `qenv` object within the `teal.code` package emerges as a pivotal tool, facilitating the development of reproducible `shiny/teal` modules.

It's worth noting that there exists a public [`shinymeta`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinymeta) R package by `RStudio`, offering similar functionality. However, integrating `shinymeta` into `teal` modules poses challenges. Consequently, we recommend the use of `qenv` for teal-based applications. 

For comprehensive insights, please refer to the [`qenv` vignette](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code/latest-tag/articles/qenv.html).
