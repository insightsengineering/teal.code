#' - `messages` (`character`) the messages output when evaluating the code element
#' - `id (`integer`) random identifier of the code element to make sure uniqueness when joining
#' - `side_effects` (`character`) names of objects that gets affected by this code call
#' - `occurrence` (`character`) names of objects that appear in this call, separated by `<-`
